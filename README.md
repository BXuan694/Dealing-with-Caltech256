# dealingWithCaltech256
This is to generate PyTorch Dataloader from original Caltech-256 .jpg files. (https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7694/)

You should have prepared Caltech-256 dataset from https://authors.library.caltech.edu/7694/. By changing the path in  .py, you can generate the .txt file with path and label like that above, thus you can use in PyTorch.
